## [Unreleased]

## [0.112.12] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- **Standalone repo**: `dracon-warden` is now a first-class standalone git
  repository at
  [`DraconDev/dracon-warden-secret-encrypt-age-git-filter`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-warden-secret-encrypt-age-git-filter).
  Previously this code lived in
  [`DraconDev/dracon-utilities`](https://github.com/DraconDev/dracon-utilities)
  as a workspace member. Source-of-truth has moved to the standalone repo;
  future releases are cut from there via `scripts/release.sh`.
- **`scripts/release.sh`**: new per-repo release script. Same interface as
  the parent monorepo's `release.sh` (`<version> --yes [--dry-run] [--abort]`),
  scoped to the standalone repo's Cargo.toml, CHANGELOG, crates.io publish,
  and GitHub release. Each utility now releases independently on its own
  cadence.
- **Push-protected remotes**: the verbose repo name
  (`dracon-warden-secret-encrypt-age-git-filter`) is the public-facing
  identity. Local directory is `dracon-warden/` for ergonomics. The
  4-keyword description in the repo metadata ("secret, encrypt, age,
  git-filter") is the canonical public description.

### Verified
- `cargo info dracon-warden` confirms version 0.112.12 on crates.io
- `gh release view v0.112.12` (verbose repo) shows the github release
- Daemon's `dracon-sync repos` continues to see this repo and pushes to
  the 3 remotes (github + gitlab + codeberg) on its own cycle
